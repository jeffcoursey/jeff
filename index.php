            <p>Jeff is survived by his brother, Jesse Coursey, who tragically passed away in the hospital while attempting to delete approximately 16 terabytes of child pornography from his devices. His other brother, Jorden Coursey, is currently making headlines in a high-profile trial involving alleged interactions with John Travolta. The Coursey family truly knows how to keep both the entertainment industry and law enforcement buzzing. Jeff's personal life was as colorful as his business practices:</p>
            <ul>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Legacy & Followers</h3>
            <p>Jeff leaves behind a devoted cult-like following of pilots who were willing to pay $129 per year for access to his exclusive Facebook group "Pilots Against Ponytails & Tax Evasion." The group's members, known as "Coursey's Crazies," were famous for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Paying premium prices for Jeff's "Holy Aviation Secrets" newsletter</li>
                <li>Following his controversial "No Haircut, No Problem" aviation techniques</li>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Final Flight</h3>
            <p>Jeff's final flight to the Sun 'n Fun airshow was reportedly sponsored by "Creative Accounting Airlines" and "Regulatory Loophole Express." Witnesses claim he was last seen trying to convince air traffic control that his aircraft was actually a "flying tax shelter" and therefore exempt from standard aviation regulations. His last words were allegedly: "I'm not crashing, I'm just making an emergency tax deduction!"</p>
